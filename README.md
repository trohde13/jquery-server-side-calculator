# SERVER SIDE CALCULATOR

## Description

_Duration: 48 Hours_

This is a Calculator class project completed during a weekend project sprint that processes the calculations on the server and presents them on the DOM. The base functionality of the calculator allows the user to make basic 2 number calculations with addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The results for each calculation will be displayed prominently and a list of all calculations made will be displayed after.
